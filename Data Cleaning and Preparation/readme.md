# Data Cleaning and Preparation
This phase focuses on refining a dataset of the most streamed Spotify songs of 2024 to ensure it is primed for analysis. The objective is to enhance data quality by addressing missing values, eliminating duplicates, and more.

## Structure of the notebook
**The notebook is structured as follows**:

* Importing Libraries: Essential libraries are imported to handle data manipulation and analysis.

* Data Loading: The dataset is loaded from a CSV file, with error handling for encoding issues.

* Initial Data Exploration:

  * Checking the structure and data types of the dataset.
  * Identifying and handling duplicates.
    
* Data Cleaning:

  * Dropping unnecessary columns.
  * Converting data types for better analysis.
  * Filling missing values with appropriate methods (e.g., mean for numerical columns).
    
* Feature Engineering:

  * Creating new columns to derive additional insights
  * Adding release date information for potential time-based analysis.
     
* Final Data Export: The cleaned and transformed dataset is saved to a new CSV file for further analysis or use.

This structured approach to data cleaning and preparation ensures that the dataset is both comprehensive and ready for insightful analysis.
